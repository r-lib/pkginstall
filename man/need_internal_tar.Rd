\title{Check if we need to use R's internal tar implementation}
\usage{
need_internal_tar()
}
\value{
Whether we need to use the internal tar implementation.
}
\description{
This is slow, because we need to start an R child process, and the
implementation is also very slow. So it is better to use an extranl tar
program, if we can. We test this by trying to uncompress a .tar.gz
archive using the external program. The name of the tar program is
taken from the \code{TAR} environment variable, if this is unset then \code{tar}
is used.
